This is a description of the lua-files 2D graphics stack listing the major modules in the pipeline,
wanted capabilities and technology choices, options and routes taken for fulfilling those capabilities.

2d vector processing
	- path simplification (complex path to curves and lines)
	- path elasticization (curves to lines) + non-linear transformation
	- affine transformation
	- curve flattening (adaptive subdivision)
	- polygon offseting
		- different line joins and line caps
		- dash line generator
		- cap markers
	- polygon clipping

2d rasterization
	- polygon rasterization
		- scanline rasterization
			- span generation
				- scanline boolean algebra?
			- gradient generation
		- outline rasterization

raster image pipeline
	- image affine transformation
		- image subpixel translation

pixel compositing
	- alpha compositing
		- porter/duff operators
	- pixel format adaptation (stride, bpp, pixel layout, etc)
