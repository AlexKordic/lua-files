- important: blur, shadow, 2d projection, perspective projection, contrast, gamma, brightness, saturation, grayscale

- bitmaps: vflip, hflip, crop, tile
- downsampling: dithering, quantization, grayscale
- projection:
	- scale up/down (linear, bilinear, bicubic, spline, lanczos), rotate (wrap, smooth), stretch, skew
	- perspective
- distortions: mesh-based warp (envelope tool, lens), wave, twist, shake, ripple
- effects: blur (split, gaussian), sharpen, antialias, solorize, posterize, emboss
- blending: porter-duff modes
- color: brightness, contrast, gamma, hue, stauration, invert

- antialiasing gamma adjustment at primitive level
- rendering modes: full, solid, outline, wireframe

rasterizer:
- gradients: linear, radial, radial focus, conic, conic angle, diamond, xy, sqrt xy, contour, auto contour, gouraud shading
