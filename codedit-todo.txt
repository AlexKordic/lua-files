- move selection (or current line) up/down with the mouse
- select by click-dragging over the line numbers column
- double click on selected word selects line
- how to select a paragraph? double click on selected line? triple click on selected word? ctrl+A ?

- user-definable margins
	- show blame info (eg. from git and hg)

- carets:
	- caret jumps - when must scroll, scroll longer so the caret can move longer before scrolling again.

- autodetect tabs mode and tabsize
	- skip empty lines
	- count the number of lines that use tabs exclusively for indentation
	- count the number of lines that use spaces exclusively for indentation
	- count the number of lines that use a mixture of tabs and spaces for indentation
	- count the number of lines that use tabs inside the line
	- count the number of lines that use multiple spaces inside the line

- rendering:
	- syntax highlighting with embedded lexers (js and css in html etc.)
	- bracket matching highlighting
	- current line highlighting
		- highlight just the line number
	- view whitespace
	- mark special chars and invalid unicode chars
	- annotations (tooltips)
	- user-definable markers
	- text styles: strike-through, underline, dashed/dotted/squiggle underline, selection rectangle,
	- long lines - display a limit bar or mark the excess with a text style
	- animated scrolling like in sublime text (actually that's pretty annoying)
	- text cursor over text, normal pointer surrounding the text, reverse pointer over the line numbers
	- spell checking (configurable to apply only to comments and strings)


CODEDITOR
---------
- file tabs
	- nav with ctrl+tab, ctrl+shift+tab
	- ctrl+n new
	- ctrl+o open
	- ctrl+w close
	- drag to reorder
	- top or bottom display
- f11 full screen
- sessions:
	- save and restore all open buffers along with view, caret and selection state
	- autosave
- customization:
	- global, local (per-project), per-filetype, per-user config files (like scite).
	- reload config on the fly when saving the config file.
	- custom key bindings.
- simultaneous edits
	- ctrl+click creates multiple cursors and movement and typing is available to all
	- ctrl+select creates multiple selections that can be copy/pasted
- hi-level feats
	- create tooltip list from the syntax hightlighter
	- integrate a spell checking library
	- integrate a Lua linter
	- minimap like sublime text
- autocompletion
- calltips
- zooming
- file change detection
- atomic save
- auto-backup (with undo/redo stack?)


QUESTIONS
---------
- find/replace macros:
	- make a table based on separators (see automatic table formatting above)
- bookmarks:
	- how to manage writing code and browsing the same code (but different parts of it) at the same time? split view?
		- idea: simple shortcut to go back to where the cursor was last time you were typing (i always use ctrl+z/ctrl+y)


features I never use
	- macros
	- printing (so 50s)
	- code folding (maybe something like autofolding/unfolding with a side window for fold contents?)
	- line wrapping
	- multiple selections
