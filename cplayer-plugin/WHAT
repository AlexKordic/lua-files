npcplayer is a browser plugin that runs a cairo player instance in a browser window.

TIPS:

- get NPAPI headers from https://code.google.com/p/npapi-sdk/
	- I stripped them of cruft (they were mostly cruft)
- dll exported functions must be __stdcall
	- gcc mangles __stdcall names
		- pass -Wl,--kill-at to demangle
- firefox loads a plugin either from a xpi package or from known locations.
	- known locations are either the registry or %APPDATA%\Mozilla\plugins
		- for loading from %APPDATA%, link the .rc file that declares the name and the mime type in dll's VERSIONINFO.
			- BLOCK "040904E4" and "Translation" 0x0409, 0x04E4 must be hardcoded like that or the plugin won't install.
			- the dll must be named np*.dll or it won't be found.
			- the "MIMEType" value must be declared or the plugin won't install.
		- for loading via registry, run the .reg file that declares the name, location and the mime types for the plugin.
	- for xpi loading see the xpi dir and the build script that creates the xpi file.
	- to check if plugin loads use:
		- about:plugins
		- use javascript:
			var mimetype = navigator.mimeTypes["application/x-cairoplayer"]
			var plugin = mimetype.enabledPlugin
			console.log(plugin.name)
			console.log(plugin.description)
		- use html:
			<embed type="application/x-cairoplayer" width="1300" height="700"></embed>
